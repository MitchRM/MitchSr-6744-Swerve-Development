# MitchSr-6744-Swerve-Development
 MitchSr repository to understand development process.
 - The intent is for development in this repository to produce a series of competition ready versions of swerve robot software.
 - The main branch is reserved for integration of features and testing on a robot prior to a merge with the competion software, creating a new competition version.
 - This first version of the code is a copy of the REV swerve template.
